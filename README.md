# nyt_recipes
This is personal project to analyze the following items from the New York Times Cooking website:

1. The most active contributors to the site (as measured by the # of recipes on the website)
2. The most popular recipes on the website (as measured by rating (1-5) and # of reviews)
3. The authors with the largest proportion of 5-star recipes (as measured by the # of recipes as a percentage of 5-star recipes)

I used BeautifulSoup to scrape data from the NYT Cooking website, but the raw data file and the scraping tools are not included in the remote repository because they contain information that is behind a paywall. This project's sole intention is to play around with the data. Please subscribe to NYTimes for access to the fantastic recipes on the website.

The next iteration of the project will use scikit-learn to build a ML tool based on the recipe database.
