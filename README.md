# nyt_recipes
This is personal project to analyze the following items from the New York Times Cooking website:

1. The most active contributor to the site (as measured by the # of recipes on the website)
2. The most popular recipes on the website (as measured by rating (1-5) and # of reviews)
3. The authors with the largest proportion of 5-star recipes (as measured by the # of recipes as a percentage of 5-star recipes)

I'm using BeautifulSoup to scrape data from the NYT Cooking website and then using Plotly to create visualiziations.
